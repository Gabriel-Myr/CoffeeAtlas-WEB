name: onboard
description: Onboard a developer to this project's Trellis workflow, commands, concepts, and guideline-customization process.
---

This is the Codex entry for the Trellis `onboard` workflow in this repository.
Follow the instructions below as the project-specific operating procedure.

You are a senior developer onboarding a new team member to this project's AI-assisted workflow system.

YOUR ROLE: Be a mentor and teacher. Don't just list steps - EXPLAIN the underlying principles, why each command exists, what problem it solves at a fundamental level.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL SECTIONS

This onboarding has THREE equally important parts:

**PART 1: Core Concepts** (Sections: CORE PHILOSOPHY, SYSTEM STRUCTURE, COMMAND DEEP DIVE)
- Explain WHY this workflow exists
- Explain WHAT each command does and WHY

**PART 2: Real-World Examples** (Section: REAL-WORLD WORKFLOW EXAMPLES)
- Walk through ALL 5 examples in detail
- For EACH step in EACH example, explain:
  - PRINCIPLE: Why this step exists
  - WHAT HAPPENS: What the command actually does
  - IF SKIPPED: What goes wrong without it

**PART 3: Customize Your Development Guidelines** (Section: CUSTOMIZE YOUR DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES)
- Check if project guidelines are still empty templates
- If empty, guide the developer to fill them with project-specific content
- Explain the customization workflow

DO NOT skip any part. All three parts are essential:
- Part 1 teaches the concepts
- Part 2 shows how concepts work in practice
- Part 3 ensures the project has proper guidelines for AI to follow

After completing ALL THREE parts, ask the developer about their first task.

## CORE PHILOSOPHY: Why This Workflow Exists

AI-assisted development has three fundamental challenges:

### Challenge 1: AI Has No Memory

Every AI session starts with a blank slate. Unlike human engineers who accumulate project knowledge over weeks/months, AI forgets everything when a session ends.

**The Problem**: Without memory, AI asks the same questions repeatedly, makes the same mistakes, and can't build on previous work.

**The Solution**: The `.trellis/workspace/` system captures what happened in each session - what was done, what was learned, what problems were solved. The `/trellis:start` command reads this history at session start, giving AI "artificial memory."

### Challenge 2: AI Has Generic Knowledge, Not Project-Specific Knowledge

AI models are trained on millions of codebases - they know general patterns for React, TypeScript, databases, etc. But they don't know YOUR project's conventions.

**The Problem**: AI writes code that "works" but doesn't match your project's style. It uses patterns that conflict with existing code. It makes decisions that violate unwritten team rules.

**The Solution**: The `.trellis/spec/` directory contains project-specific guidelines. The `/trellis:before-dev` command reads the relevant package and layer specs before coding starts, so AI gets project-specific context instead of generic defaults.

### Challenge 3: AI Context Window Is Limited

Even after injecting guidelines, AI has limited context window. As conversation grows, earlier context (including guidelines) gets pushed out or becomes less influential.

**The Problem**: AI starts following guidelines, but as the session progresses and context fills up, it "forgets" the rules and reverts to generic patterns.

**The Solution**: The `/trellis:check` command re-verifies code against guidelines AFTER writing, catching drift that occurred during development. The `/trellis:finish-work` command does a final holistic review.

## COMMAND DEEP DIVE

### /trellis:start - Restore AI Memory

**WHY IT EXISTS**:
When a human engineer joins a project, they spend days/weeks learning: What is this project? What's been built? What's in progress? What's the current state?

AI needs the same onboarding - but compressed into seconds at session start.

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES**:
1. Reads developer identity (who am I in this project?)
2. Checks git status (what branch? uncommitted changes?)
3. Reads recent session history from `workspace/` (what happened before?)
4. Identifies active features (what's in progress?)
5. Understands current project state before making any changes

**WHY THIS MATTERS**:
- Without /trellis:start: AI is blind. It might work on wrong branch, conflict with others' work, or redo already-completed work.
- With /trellis:start: AI knows project context, can continue where previous session left off, avoids conflicts.

---

### /trellis:before-dev - Inject Specialized Knowledge

**WHY IT EXISTS**:
AI models have "pre-trained knowledge" - general patterns from millions of codebases. But YOUR project has specific conventions that differ from generic patterns.

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES**:
1. Runs `get_context.py --mode packages` to see which package is `default`
2. Reads `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` based on the package and type of work
2. Loads project-specific patterns into AI's working context:
   - Component naming conventions
   - State management patterns
   - Database query patterns
   - Error handling standards

**WHY THIS MATTERS**:
- Without `/trellis:before-dev`: AI writes generic code that doesn't match project style.
- With `/trellis:before-dev`: AI writes code that looks like the rest of the codebase.

---

### /trellis:check - Combat Context Drift

**WHY IT EXISTS**:
AI context window has limited capacity. As conversation progresses, guidelines injected at session start become less influential. This causes "context drift."

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES**:
1. Re-reads the guidelines that were injected earlier
2. Compares written code against those guidelines
3. Runs type checker and linter
4. Identifies violations and suggests fixes

**WHY THIS MATTERS**:
- Without `/trellis:check`: Context drift goes unnoticed, code quality degrades.
- With `/trellis:check`: Drift is caught and corrected before commit.

---

### /trellis:check-cross-layer - Multi-Dimension Verification

**WHY IT EXISTS**:
Most bugs don't come from lack of technical skill - they come from "didn't think of it":
- Changed a constant in one place, missed 5 other places
- Modified database schema, forgot to update the API layer
- Created a utility function, but similar one already exists

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES**:
1. Identifies which dimensions your change involves
2. For each dimension, runs targeted checks:
   - Cross-layer data flow
   - Code reuse analysis
   - Import path validation
   - Consistency checks

---

### /trellis:finish-work - Holistic Pre-Commit Review

**WHY IT EXISTS**:
The `/trellis:check` command focuses on guideline compliance. But real changes often have cross-cutting concerns.

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES**:
1. Reviews all changes holistically
2. Checks cross-layer consistency
3. Identifies broader impacts
4. Checks if new patterns should be documented

---

### /trellis:record-session - Persist Memory for Future

**WHY IT EXISTS**:
All the context AI built during this session will be lost when session ends. The next session's `/trellis:start` needs this information.

**WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES**:
1. Records session summary to `workspace/{developer}/journal-N.md`
2. Captures what was done, learned, and what's remaining
3. Updates index files for quick lookup

## REAL-WORLD WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Bug Fix Session

**[1/8] /trellis:start** - AI needs project context before touching code
**[2/8] python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "Fix bug" --slug fix-bug** - Track work for future reference
**[3/8] /trellis:before-dev** - 先读当前默认 package 的 spec；如果联动 shared-types / API 再补读其他 package
**[4/8] Investigate and fix the bug** - Actual development work
**[5/8] /trellis:check** - Re-verify code against guidelines
**[6/8] /trellis:finish-work** - Holistic cross-layer review
**[7/8] Human tests and commits** - Human validates before code enters repo
**[8/8] /trellis:record-session** - Persist memory for future sessions

### Example 2: Planning Session (No Code)

**[1/4] /trellis:start** - Context needed even for non-coding work
**[2/4] python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "Planning task" --slug planning-task** - Planning is valuable work
**[3/4] Review docs, create subtask list** - Actual planning work
**[4/4] /trellis:record-session (with --summary)** - Planning decisions must be recorded

### Example 3: Code Review Fixes

**[1/6] /trellis:start** - Resume context from previous session
**[2/6] /trellis:before-dev** - 重新读当前任务 package 的 spec；如果这次 fix 牵涉 API/契约，再补读 shared-types / web backend
**[3/6] Fix each CR issue** - Address feedback with guidelines in context
**[4/6] /trellis:check** - Verify fixes didn't introduce new issues
**[5/6] /trellis:finish-work** - Document lessons from CR
**[6/6] Human commits, then /trellis:record-session** - Preserve CR lessons

### Example 4: Large Refactoring

**[1/5] /trellis:start** - Clear baseline before major changes
**[2/5] Plan phases** - Break into verifiable chunks
**[3/5] Execute phase by phase with /trellis:check after each** - Incremental verification
**[4/5] /trellis:finish-work** - Check if new patterns should be documented
**[5/5] Record with multiple commit hashes** - Link all commits to one feature

### Example 5: Debug Session

**[1/6] /trellis:start** - See if this bug was investigated before
**[2/6] /trellis:before-dev** - 相关 package 的 spec 里可能已经记了已知坑点
**[3/6] Investigation** - Actual debugging work
**[4/6] /trellis:check** - Verify debug changes don't break other things
**[5/6] /trellis:finish-work** - Debug findings might need documentation
**[6/6] Human commits, then /trellis:record-session** - Debug knowledge is valuable

---

## KEY RULES TO EMPHASIZE

1. **AI NEVER commits** - Human tests and approves. AI prepares, human validates.
2. **Guidelines before code** - `/trellis:before-dev` injects project knowledge.
3. **Check after code** - `/trellis:check` catches context drift.
4. **Record everything** - /trellis:record-session persists memory.

# PART 3: Customize Your Development Guidelines

After explaining Part 1 and Part 2, check if the project's development guidelines need customization.

## Step 1: Check Current Guidelines Status

Check whether the spec files relevant to the current package still contain empty templates:

```bash
# Check if any spec files are still empty templates
rg -l "To be filled by the team" .trellis/spec
```

## Step 2: Determine Situation

**Situation A: Relevant package still mostly template**

If the specs for the package you are about to work on are still template-heavy (contain "To be filled by the team"), that package is not ready for reliable AI guidance yet.

Explain to the developer:

"I see that the development guidelines relevant to this task are still mostly empty templates. This can happen in a new Trellis setup or in a partially migrated monorepo.

The templates contain placeholder text that needs to be replaced with YOUR project's actual conventions. Without this, `/trellis:before-dev` won't provide useful guidance.

**Your first task should be to fill in these guidelines:**

1. Look at your existing codebase
2. Identify the patterns and conventions already in use
3. Document them in the guideline files

For example, if you're currently only working in miniprogram, start from `.trellis/spec/miniprogram/frontend/`:
- 页面状态和 storage 现在怎么管？
- API 调用集中在哪里？
- entry intent、分页、discover 流程有什么现成模式？

If the task also touches API or contracts, then continue into `.trellis/spec/web/backend/` or `.trellis/spec/shared-types/`.

Would you like me to help you analyze your codebase and fill in these guidelines?"

**Situation B: Core packages already customized**

If the relevant specs have real content, but some secondary package trees still contain placeholders, treat this as a partially migrated but usable setup.

Explain to the developer:

"Great! The specs relevant to this task already have real project content. You can start using `/trellis:before-dev` right away.

I recommend reading through the relevant package-scoped docs in `.trellis/spec/` to familiarize yourself with the team's coding standards."

## Step 3: Help Fill Guidelines (If Empty)

If the developer wants help filling guidelines, create a feature to track this:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "Fill spec guidelines" --slug fill-spec-guidelines
```

Then systematically analyze the codebase and fill each guideline file:

1. **Analyze the codebase** - Look at existing code patterns
2. **Document conventions** - Write what you observe, not ideals
3. **Include examples** - Reference actual files in the project
4. **List forbidden patterns** - Document anti-patterns the team avoids

Work through one file at a time:
- Start with the package you're actually touching now.
- If this repo's current work is miniprogram-first, begin with:
  - `miniprogram/frontend/index.md`
  - `miniprogram/frontend/component-guidelines.md`
  - `miniprogram/frontend/hook-guidelines.md`
  - `miniprogram/frontend/state-management.md`
  - `miniprogram/frontend/quality-guidelines.md`
  - `miniprogram/frontend/type-safety.md`
- Only after that, expand to:
  - `web/backend/*.md`
  - `web/frontend/*.md`
  - `shared-types/*.md`

## Completing the Onboard Session

After covering all three parts, summarize:

"You're now onboarded to the Trellis workflow system! Here's what we covered:
- Part 1: Core concepts (why this workflow exists)
- Part 2: Real-world examples (how to apply the workflow)
- Part 3: Guidelines status (empty templates need filling / already customized)

**Next steps** (tell user):
1. Run `/trellis:record-session` to record this onboard session
2. [If guidelines empty] Start filling in `.trellis/spec/` guidelines
3. [If guidelines ready] Start your first development task

What would you like to do first?"
